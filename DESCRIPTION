Description: This R package can process high-throughput sequence data from raw reads to alignments 
  ready for analysis in popular phylogenetics software. The package acts as a wrapper around other
  programs to preprocess the raw read sequence data for alignment. The package implements the program
  sPades to assemble the raw reads. Finally, custom functions can match assembled contigs to various
  types of target files (transcripts, exons, UCEs, etc.) and align the matching targets individually
  for each locus. The package can trim and further process alignments for different types of programs
  and analyses (alignment conversion, concatenation, alignment statistics, trimming).

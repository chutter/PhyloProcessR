# PhyloCap

R package For processing high-throughput sequencing data for many samples from targeted sequence capture. The R package and pipeline does the following:

1) Organize raw read data
2) Remove adaptor contamination and merge paired-end reads
3) Decontaminate reads from other organisms
4) Assemble cleaned reads into contigs 
5) Use a sample-based iterative mapping approach to call SNPs and export for popular programs
6) Match contigs to design targets for sequence capture
7) Align and trim contigs from samples
8) Concatenate all targets or only targets from the same gene
9) Estimate gene trees for each target
10) Gene Jackknifing concatenation tree building

# Installation of prerequisites 

PhyloCap uses several R packages and other outside programs for certain functions. 

1. R version 4.0.2 (and above likely work)

Requires:
- devtools
- ape
- stringr
- data.table
- seqinr
- biostrings (Bioconductor)
- genomicranges (Bioconductor)

Imports:
- foreach
- doparallel
- rdrop2



2. Outside programs

- fastp: adaptor trimming and paired-end read merging
- bwa: read mapping
- spades: assembly
- BLAST: matching assembled contigs to targets, other utilities
- mafft: creating alignments
- trimal: trimming alignments
- IqTree: gene tree and concatenation trees
- GATK4: variant calling functions
- SamTools: variant calling and read mapping tools


First, you will want to clone this repository to your computer to obtain the setup files. Or alternatively go to the green "Code" button in top right of this repository and select "download ZIP".

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chutter/PhyloCap.git
```

Second, change your working directory in the terminal to the downloaded repository. The key file here is the "PhyloCap.yml" anaconda environment file, which must be present in the working directory being used. 

```bash
cd /PhyloCap/setup-configuration_files/
```

The R packages and outside programs can be installed manually or more easily through the anaconda environment file provided (version numbers are provided in environment file if manual installation is desired). To install with the environment file, the easiest and quickest way is to first install the Anaconda package manager. Anaconda can be downloaded and installed for different operating systems from https://anaconda.org. Miniconda is recommended. Once installed, you can create a new environment for PhyloCap by: 

```bash
conda env create -f PhyloCap.yml -n PhyloCap
```

OR if a specific location for the environment directory is needed:

```bash
conda env create -f PhyloCap.yml -p /PLACE/YOUR/DIRECTORY/HERE/PhyloCap
```

And finally, you may delete the cloned GitHub directory after installing the prerequisites through the conda env file that manually installs the anaconda environment. There are some useful examples (also in the tutorial here), which could be saved.   

To use the environment, it must first be activated in your current terminal session or placed in your cluster job script. 

```bash
conda activate PhyloCap
```

OR if a specific location for the environment directory is needed:

```bash
conda activate /PLACE/YOUR/DIRECTORY/HERE/PhyloCap
```

# Installation of R package

The main functions of PhyloCap are contained in an R package that has been tested on R version 4.0.2 and use the listed programs above along with custom scripts. To install PhyloCap from GitHub, you can use the R package devtools included in the environment above. When running in a cluster environment, the code for installation here should be included at the top of your R script with your selected PhyloCap functions. Here are step-by-step instructions for installation:

1) Install PhyloCap by typing in your R console: 

```R
devtools::install_github("chutter/PhyloCap", update = "never", dependencies = FALSE)
```

The update = "never" flag ensures that packages already installed via the anaconda environment are not changed, which will often break things. Additionally, dependencies = FALSE is set for the same reason. 


2) Devtools should finish and say the package loaded properly with no errors. Load the package in your R script with:

```R
library(PhyloCap)
```

And installation should be done! All the functions for PhyloCap should be ready to go! It is recommended to keep the install line above in your R script as the package is frequently updated for bugs and other features. In the future when there is a stable release, the R package will be available through Anaconda. 


3) You can run the following function to see if PhyloCap can find the dependencies:
